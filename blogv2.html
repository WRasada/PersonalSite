        <hr class="blogSeparator">
        <p>Currently, as it stands, this blog does not have a database or any real easy way for me to add posts. This is just to get something up and running until I build an official blogging app. So it's definitely not ideal and I should have the final one up and running within a couple weeks. Until then, i'll just be posting by adding a new post in the HTML and then redeploying the website. Fun stuff!</p>

          <hr class="blogSeparator">
          <p>I've learned a lot and I'm continuing to learn a lot. Currently, the way my site is hosted, I do not have access to using a specific database, MongoDB. It's the one I've been learning a lot on recently and the only one I have available is MySQL. I could probably learn it but I want to focus on MongoDB for the moment. For this reason, I'll be having to host my site elsewhere, probably Amazon Web Services or Heroku. This means i'll be rebuilding my site to have access to databases/backend technologies. I'm going to halt the progress on my site for right now and my goal is to have the new one up and running within a couple weeks. I'll continue to post blogs here until its finished and then migrate everything over. Stay tuned and thanks for reading!</p>

          <h2 class="blogTitle">The Journey Begins</h2>
          <div class="posts">
          <p>What might that journey be, you wonder? Well, if your here reading this then you probably guessed what it is but I can tell you it's going to change my life for the better. Programming, software engineering, coding, whatever you want to call it, that is what the journey entails. It's one I've dabbled in from time to time but never took seriously. While I regret not taking it seriously earlier on, all I can say is that its better late than never and its never too late.</p>
          <p>So lets talk about what I've learned so far. For the past couple months i've learned some Ruby and Rails and built a small little web app, <a href="m-badlands-25451.herokuapp.com">DevMatch</a>. I spent a good amount of time the first month going through this course and nailing everything down. After that though, things slowed down a bit. Trying to find what to learn and just getting overwhelmed on just where to start. Last week, I can finally say I've found what I need to keep me going and I'm latching onto it. So within this week, I've learned quite a substantial amount.  Here's a small list of what I learned:
          <ul>
            <li>HTML (Refresher)</li>
            <li>CSS (Refresher)</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
          </ul> and the list will keep growing. It also doesn't mean I'm an expert on those topics rather I know the basics. All I can do now is code everyday, which I've been doing this whole week and in the past 7 days have logged 42 hours while still working full-time. Some may say to not burn yourself out or you'll lose motivation. I can safely say that its not motivation keeping me going but discipline and I couldn't be happier. I've learned so much and I'm excited to keep learning and building up this website with everything that I learn. I started building this site this morning and I'm pretty happy with it so far. Still need more practice with design and layout. It's pretty hard just making something look clean and simple but that's where practice will help me. I'll be adding more javascript to the site to help with interactivity. For example this blog post can be minimized if you click the plus sign! Pretty cool! =D</p>

          <p>I look forward to building my skills and eventually landing that developer job! Wish me luck and I'll update everyone next weekend! Probably some new changes to the site too!</p>

          <h2 class="blogTitle">Backend Web Development - Deep Dive</h2>
          <div class="posts">
          <p>Another exciting week in my journey. This one mostly consisted of backend development. To start, let me just explain what Backend is. Web development consists of Frontend and Backend. Frontend is what you see on a webpage and can interact with. Backend consists of databases and dynamic webpages. For example, you have a webpage with a form to Sign Up. Frontend handles all the inputs and then when you click the submit button, the Backend snatches the data in the inputs and sends it to the database. This works for any type of form/input and data. I could go on a whole blog posts explaining it better. Maybe I will later once I get more understanding of everything!</p>
          <p>So lets talk about this past week. I've learned a substantial amount and this whole next week will be me just practicing everything I've learned. To first show what I worked on, <a href="https://hidden-earth-87635.herokuapp.com/">YelpCamp</a>. It's fully functional with a user, campground, and comment database. Go ahead and sign up, add a campground, post comments, anything! Its pretty awesome! Some features are disabled but i'll be slowly updating it as I learn more. Right now, I'm finished with it and i'll be working on mutliple projects to help retain what I learned. A list of the technologies I used/learned:
          <ul>
            <li>Javascript</li>
              <ul>
                <li>jQuery</li>
                <li>Node.js</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>NPM</li>
                    <li>Express</li>
                    <li>Body-parser</li>
                    <li>passport</li>
                    <li>mongoose</li>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
            <li>MongoDB</li>
            <li>Authentication</li>
            <li>Authorization</li>
          </ul> I learned a lot more with Node.js but the list would go on. So as you can see, I learned quite a bit this week. So its best for me right now to really practice what I've learned and hopefully by next weekend have some new projects and then move onto more courses. Speaking of courses, I completed udemy.com "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course! Super exciting! you can check my twitter for the certificate! I'm excited to keep learning!</p>
          <p>Although I've been programming on and off, I believe two weeks ago is when my journey really started. I'm so excited and motivated to keep working on coding and see what the future holds for me! Look forward to future updates to my site! I said I would have my blog up and running this week but I want to focus on practicing what I've learned and then in 1-2 weeks i'll have some big changes to the site! Look out for next week's blog post!</p>

          <h2 class="blogTitle">What it takes to learn</h2>
          <div class="posts">
          <p>Wow, I have to say that I've learned so much in such a short time! For starters, Last weeks post I mentioned I completed my "Web Developer Bootcamp" course on udemy. This was a big accomplishment for me. I know udemy isn't a prestigious school or anything but it's a great way to learn and I learned a ton! Here's the certificate, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-9R0DIP12/">Certificate</a>, and I'm excited to continue with the courses and get more certificates! I felt like I could program anything after finishing that course but that clearly was not the case for this weeks practice.</p>
          <p>While I did get practice in this week, it became evidently clear that what I learned in the course was not wired into my brain. Trying to program the same exact thing I did in the course was more of a struggle than I thought. Constantly having to go back and check how to do this by looking at the code I had already written. I know its only my first week after completing the course but it became very frustrating. I understand how the code works but trying to remember everything and how it all connects proved challenging. It's not to say that I gave up this week but rather figuring out what I need to do to push forward and continue to learn and grow as a developer.</p>
          <p>I learned a lot this week not just on programming in general but also how to build the right mindset when learning something. It's easy to dream and think of where you want to be in X months/years. For me, it's motivational but can also be quite detrimental to my progress. For example, I felt I was accomplishing a lot during the course and really saw myself improving at a rapid rate. Once I finished though, things really started to slow down. All I wanted to do was keep learning but instead was struggling with practicing things I already learned. I now realize that even though I learned so much, I need months of practice to retain it all. It might seem plainly obvious but when your struggling with something, a lot of times you want to give up but really you just need practice. I'm pretty quick at learning new skills but this is the one skill where it's going to take years to master.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, I'm going to be taking two courses, Node.JS and MongoDB, both of which were covered in the bootcamp. I'm confident these two courses will give me a good review on what I already learned but also understanding their core better. I'm currently 43% done in Node.JS and hope to be done by the middle of the week and then move onto MongoDB. I'm not going to be defeated by this and I will be practicing everyday and you can follow my Twitter for daily tweets!</p>

          <h2 class="blogTitle">First Month: Completed</h2>
          <div class="posts">
          <p>What a journey it's been so far and its only been one month. I've learned so much. Its exciting to learn all these new technologies and I can't wait to use them in future projects! I will say this is only the beginning and I have a long road ahead of me. Practice, practice, practice, and more practice that's what I need to keep doing. It's definitely not easy. There are times when I question myself if I'm really capable of doing this. It's an extremely frustrating process but I just have to keep moving forward.</p>
          <p>So my goal for the next couple months is to focus on the MEAN stack. For those who don't know what I'm talking about, it's basically a set of technologies that one would use in creating a website. It's an acronym:
          <ul>
          <li>M = MongoDB</li>
          <li>E = Express</li>
          <li>A = Angular</li>
          <li>N = Node</li>
          </ul> Each one has a particular use in creating a website. I won't go into detail for each one but so far I've been learning MongoDB, Express, and Node. I'm going to wait to get into Angular until I can fully grasp the other three. Angular is mostly used for Frontend development and building nice responsive and interactive user interfaces. These next two months will be focused on practicing everything I've learned. I'm hoping I'll have enough experience in two months to build some nice side projects! I have a couple projects lined up already!</p>
          <p>So this blog post isn't as long as the others but just a quick update on my one month progress and my goals for the next couple months. Lots of practice involved. I will not falter! It's extremely hard but I will keep pushing on! Wish me luck and i'll post another update next week!</p>
