        <hr class="blogSeparator">
        <p>Currently, as it stands, this blog does not have a database or any real easy way for me to add posts. This is just to get something up and running until I build an official blogging app. So it's definitely not ideal and I should have the final one up and running within a couple weeks. Until then, i'll just be posting by adding a new post in the HTML and then redeploying the website. Fun stuff!</p>

          <h2 class="blogTitle">The Journey Begins</h2>
          <div class="posts post1">
          <p>What might that journey be, you wonder? Well, if your here reading this then you probably guessed what it is but I can tell you it's going to change my life for the better. Programming, software engineering, coding, whatever you want to call it, that is what the journey entails. It's one I've dabbled in from time to time but never took seriously. While I regret not taking it seriously earlier on, all I can say is that its better late than never and its never too late.</p>
          <p>So lets talk about what I've learned so far. For the past couple months i've learned some Ruby and Rails and built a small little web app, <a href="m-badlands-25451.herokuapp.com">DevMatch</a>. I spent a good amount of time the first month going through this course and nailing everything down. After that though, things slowed down a bit. Trying to find what to learn and just getting overwhelmed on just where to start. Last week, I can finally say I've found what I need to keep me going and I'm latching onto it. So within this week, I've learned quite a substantial amount.  Here's a small list of what I learned:
          <ul>
            <li>HTML (Refresher)</li>
            <li>CSS (Refresher)</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
          </ul> and the list will keep growing. It also doesn't mean I'm an expert on those topics rather I know the basics. All I can do now is code everyday, which I've been doing this whole week and in the past 7 days have logged 42 hours while still working full-time. Some may say to not burn yourself out or you'll lose motivation. I can safely say that its not motivation keeping me going but discipline and I couldn't be happier. I've learned so much and I'm excited to keep learning and building up this website with everything that I learn. I started building this site this morning and I'm pretty happy with it so far. Still need more practice with design and layout. It's pretty hard just making something look clean and simple but that's where practice will help me. I'll be adding more javascript to the site to help with interactivity. For example this blog post can be minimized if you click the plus sign! Pretty cool! =D</p>

          <p>I look forward to building my skills and eventually landing that developer job! Wish me luck and I'll update everyone next weekend! Probably some new changes to the site too!</p>

          <h2 class="blogTitle">Backend Web Development - Deep Dive</h2>
          <div class="posts post2">
          <p>Another exciting week in my journey. This one mostly consisted of backend development. To start, let me just explain what Backend is. Web development consists of Frontend and Backend. Frontend is what you see on a webpage and can interact with. Backend consists of databases and dynamic webpages. For example, you have a webpage with a form to Sign Up. Frontend handles all the inputs and then when you click the submit button, the Backend snatches the data in the inputs and sends it to the database. This works for any type of form/input and data. I could go on a whole blog posts explaining it better. Maybe I will later once I get more understanding of everything!</p>
          <p>So lets talk about this past week. I've learned a substantial amount and this whole next week will be me just practicing everything I've learned. To first show what I worked on, <a href="https://hidden-earth-87635.herokuapp.com/">YelpCamp</a>. It's fully functional with a user, campground, and comment database. Go ahead and sign up, add a campground, post comments, anything! Its pretty awesome! Some features are disabled but i'll be slowly updating it as I learn more. Right now, I'm finished with it and i'll be working on mutliple projects to help retain what I learned. A list of the technologies I used/learned:
          <ul>
            <li>Javascript</li>
              <ul>
                <li>jQuery</li>
                <li>Node.js</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>NPM</li>
                    <li>Express</li>
                    <li>Body-parser</li>
                    <li>passport</li>
                    <li>mongoose</li>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
            <li>MongoDB</li>
            <li>Authentication</li>
            <li>Authorization</li>
          </ul> I learned a lot more with Node.js but the list would go on. So as you can see, I learned quite a bit this week. So its best for me right now to really practice what I've learned and hopefully by next weekend have some new projects and then move onto more courses. Speaking of courses, I completed udemy.com "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course! Super exciting! you can check my twitter for the certificate! I'm excited to keep learning!</p>
          <p>Although I've been programming on and off, I believe two weeks ago is when my journey really started. I'm so excited and motivated to keep working on coding and see what the future holds for me! Look forward to future updates to my site! I said I would have my blog up and running this week but I want to focus on practicing what I've learned and then in 1-2 weeks i'll have some big changes to the site! Look out for next week's blog post!
