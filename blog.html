        <p>Currently, as it stands, this blog does not have a database or any real easy way for me to add posts. This is just to get something up and running until I build an official blogging app. So it's definitely not ideal and I should have the final one up and running within a couple weeks. Until then, i'll just be posting by adding a new post in the HTML and then redeploying the website. Fun stuff!</p>

          <h2 class="blogTitle">The Journey Begins</h2>
          <p>What might that journey might be, you wonder? Well, if your here reading this then you probably guessed what it is but I can tell you it's going to change my life for the better. Programming, software engineering, coding, whatever you want to call it, that is what the journey entails. It's one I've dabbled in from time to time but never took seriously. While I regret not taking it seriously earlier on, all I can say is that its better late than never and its never too late.</p>
          <p>So lets talk about what I've learned so far. For the past couple months i've learned some Ruby and Rails and built a small little web app, <a href="m-badlands-25451.herokuapp.com">DevMatch</a>. I spent a good amount of time the first month going through this course and nailing everything down. After that though, things slowed down a bit. Trying to find what to learn and just getting overwhelmed on just where to start. Last week, I can finally say I've found what I need to keep me going and I'm latching onto it. So within this week, I've learned quite a substantial amount.  Here's a small list of what I learned:
          <ul>
            <li>HTML (Refresher)</li>
            <li>CSS (Refresher)</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
          </ul> and the list will keep growing. It also doesn't mean I'm an expert on those topics rather I know the basics. All I can do now is code everyday, which I've been doing this whole week and in the past 7 days have logged 42 hours while still working full-time. Some may say to not burn yourself out or you'll lose motivation. I can safely say that its not motivation keeping me going but discipline and I couldn't be happier. I've learned so much and I'm excited to keep learning and building up this website with everything that I learn. I started building this site this morning and I'm pretty happy with it so far. Still need more practice with design and layout. It's pretty hard just making something look clean and simple but that's where practice will help me. I'll be adding more javascript to the site to help with interactivity. For example this blog post can be minimized if you click the plus sign! Pretty cool! =D</p>

          <p>I look forward to building my skills and eventually landing that developer job! Wish me luck and I'll update everyone next weekend! Probably some new changes to the site too!</p>
